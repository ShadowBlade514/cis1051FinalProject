# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Chess

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An interactive program that allows you to play chess.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This program will display a chess board and chess pieces. Two players will be able to alternate turns, take each other's pieces, and check one another. This will be done through setting up different classes and functions and rules for each piece and conditions for different scenarios. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will make a board with movable pieces on it able to take opposing pieces. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to have all chess conditions and rules working within the program by the end.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The program could have an opponent AI system to play against.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

-Import a board and display a visual aspect to use to play
-Define each piece of chess
-Create move sets for each piece

I will need to learn how class sytems work, how to display a board, how to make pieces interactive and respond real-time to interactions.
I will need to research how to do each of the tasks listed above.
I plan to look up templates and walkthroughs of how this is done and research components that are unknown to me to build a program of my own.
